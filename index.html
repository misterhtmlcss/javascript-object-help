    <h1>Holder page for Object lessons</h1>
    <p>I'll be putting up an email form soon, so you can subscribe for the lessons as they are published. This could take a while, but I won't stop you from getting informed if that's what you want.</p>
    <p>GitHub Project link.</p>
    <p>Until I have a form and an integration with an email provider or some such, feel free to comment your interest on <a href="https://github.com/misterhtmlcss/javascript-object-help/labels/SubscribeMe">GitHub</a> </p>
