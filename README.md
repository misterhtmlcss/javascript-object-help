# Do you need help with Objects? 
**Then I'm creating this web page for me and for YOU**, because I am spending months and months trying to get it crystal clear and awesome in my head and what I've learned is that there are unnecessary _gaps_ in the learning experience online.

## Initial Notes

### Content: Object creation, manipulation, propagation, etc.
It looks to me like there is some disconnect between different Object creation methodologies. The why's and when's seem to be not included. Which is fine, since most videos focus on how something works, but for true newbs like me, how and when is super key too. ESPECIALLY in relation to one another.

#### propagation! Hahaha 
What's funny is propagation is a word used in many many other english language scenarios that behave like prototypes, but software developers created their own venacular, however I'm stepping away from it for this project though and I'll try to stick with common English language terms that reference the same thing.

### Layout plan
The goal for this project long-term is to have a vertical layout that allows for the topical points to be listed vertically in squence, page by page (scroll for the next topic) and for the different learning material to be side-loaded as needed. Graphics will be uploaded shortly to show this and what's planned.
